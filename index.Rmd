Hello!
I am a Master student at Iowa State University (ISU) since 2016. My major professor is Dr. Emily Berg. I got my bachelor degree in Finance from ISU. 

I have been already living in ISU for more than 5 years, and I really like this place. It likes my second home country. 

Here is the video for ISU:\
